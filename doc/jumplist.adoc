Tuxmux includes a feature known as the "*Jump List,*" which is designed to streamline the process of navigating and
attaching to different sessions quickly. This concept is inspired by the "harpooning" concept introduced in
link:{harpoon}[ThePrimeagen/harpoon]. The Jump List serves as a powerful tool to facilitate seamless interaction with
multiple sessions.

== What is Harpooning?

Harpooning is a concept from ThePrimeagen's GitHub project, which involves quickly and efficiently attaching to
different sessions or targets within a terminal environment. It's a technique often used by developers and power users
who work with multiple terminal sessions simultaneously.

== Using the Jump List

The primary use case for the Jump List is to enable quick access and attachment to specific sessions through
keybindings. Here's how it works:

Populating the Jump List::
Before you can use the Jump List, you need to populate it with the sessions you want to interact with. This can
typically be done by defining a set of sessions or targets within your application's configuration.

[source,bash]
.shell
----
# Appends the path argument to the jumplist
tux jump --path ~/.config/nvim

# Append the current path to the jumplist
tux jump --path .

# Open the jumplist in your $EDITOR
tux jump --edit
----

Navigating with Keybindings::
Once the Jump List is populated, you can use keybindings or keyboard shortcuts to navigate to a specific index within
the list. Each index typically corresponds to a session or target. This allows you to jump to a desired session with a
single key combination.

[source,bash]
.~/.config/tmux.conf
----
# Bind homerow keys to tuxmux jumplist indices
bind-key -r J   run-shell "tux jump --index 1"
bind-key -r K   run-shell "tux jump --index 2"
bind-key -r L   run-shell "tux jump --index 3"
bind-key -r '"' run-shell "tux jump --index 4"
----

Seamless Session Attachment::
When you activate a specific index in the Jump List, the application will swiftly attach you to the corresponding
session, streamlining the process of interacting with multiple sessions efficiently.
